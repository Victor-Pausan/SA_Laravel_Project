# Gym Franchise Management Platform

This repository contains the source code for a **Gym Franchise Management Platform**, a web application built with **Laravel**. This project was developed as the final requirement for the training program at **GSD Software & Technology** in Sibiu, Romania.

The platform serves as a central hub for a gym franchise, allowing users to interact with different gym locations, manage their memberships, and engage with training classes.
